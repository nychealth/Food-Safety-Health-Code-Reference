# NYC Food Safety Health Code Reference Tool for Inspectors
[Click here to launch the Food Safety Health Code Reference Tool for inspectors](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Bk4zv/4/). This works best on a mobile device.

## Architecture

The table, [Violation-Health-Code-Mapping.csv](https://github.com/nychealth/Food-Safety-Health-Code-Reference/blob/main/Violation-Health-Code-Mapping.csv), contains a description of food service establishment violations cited in New York City, along with the corresponding section of the health code. Violations come from Article 81 of the NYC Health Code, part 14 of the NY State Sanitary Code, and Article 28 of the Public Health Law.

[The application](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Bk4zv/4/) is built as a table using Datawrapper and is optimized for mobile devices.

This file will be updated when there are major changes to the health code that pertain to food service establishments, which occur every few years.

NYC Health Department staff should note that to update the app properly, ```Violation-Health-Code-Mapping.csv``` should be updated with the same column headers as the existing file, and it should be uploaded with the same name and file format (.csv). Once that is done, the Food Safety Health Code Reference Tool for Inspectors will automatically update.
